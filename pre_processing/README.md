## Data Pre-processing :

### These 2 notebooks create the main cleaned dataset and the temperatures dataset that we use in the rest of the project, so they need to be ran before you do anything else.
### Also, this might be the right time to create a virtual environment and to do 'pip -r requirements.txt' to install all the required packages.
### Before running the notebook :
1. Download the dataset as a zip file [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00235/household_power_consumption.zip)
2. Unzip the downloaded file in this folder (/pre_processing)
3. Run all cells and you are ready to run all other notebooks !
