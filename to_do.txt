1. Graphs made of multiple sub graphs. Each sub graph represents one of the variables of the dataset. For each variable we have 3 curves : business days, weekends, holidays.
    We can make this Graph in different variations : days, hours, minutes
    
2. We can do it otherwise, one Graph for each hour of the day, day of the week : here each sub graphs represents the same as before variables curves according to business days, weekends, holidays

3. Make graphs to show the distribution of each variables of the dataset

4. regression polynomiale (a priori degré 2 suffit) sur le graph 'avg global consumption per week in 2007' pour résumer la tendance

5. Fill NaN with mean values instead of deleting the rows, as to avoid discontinuity in our data. Hopefully it will solve the missing part in May in the moving average of the global consumption over time (code cell 17).

6. Faire des graphs intéractifs avec sliders pour changer l'année/semaine/jour/heure, slider pour choisir la variable, etc.
